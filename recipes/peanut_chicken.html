        </li>
        <li>Pour the tomatoes and chicken stock into the skillet, and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
            Stir in peanut butter, and cook stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.
            This should only take a minute or two.
            If the sauce is not thickening, you may stir in more peanut butter.  If this is not the case, you may not.
